# Socratic Learning Assistant for Data Structures ðŸ§ 
This is an AI-powered learning assistant designed to help users explore and understand data structures (such as arrays, trees, graphs, and linked lists) using the Socratic method. Built using Streamlit and Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Pro), the assistant guides learners by asking probing questions rather than providing direct answers, encouraging deeper understanding.

## Features
- **Socratic Teaching:** The assistant responds to user input by asking follow-up questions, helping learners arrive at the correct conclusions on their own.
- **Conversation Memory:** The assistant remembers the context of the conversation and uses it to ask relevant, connected questions throughout the interaction.
- **Simple Interface:** The user-friendly Streamlit-based interface makes interacting with the assistant intuitive and engaging.
- **Powered by Google Generative AI:** Utilizing the latest in AI technology (Gemini 1.5 Pro), the assistant provides intelligent, context-aware responses to guide learning.
